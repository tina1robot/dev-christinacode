# ChristinaCode

A modernized React version of my personal portfolio and projects site. This repo is a work-in-progress where I'm migrating my existing HTML website into a React framework while refactoring and improving the overall design and user experience.

## Project Goals

- Migrate existing portfolio content from static HTML to a maintainable React codebase
- Modernize the design and improve responsiveness
- Practice React patterns and component architecture
- Build a solid foundation for future portfolio updates and projects

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed

### Development
```bash
npm start
```

Runs the app in development mode at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). The page reloads on changes, and lint errors appear in the console.

### Building for Production
```bash
npm run build
```

Creates an optimized production build in the `build` folder, ready for deployment.

### Other Commands
```bash
npm test
```
Runs the test suite in interactive watch mode.
